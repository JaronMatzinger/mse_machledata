    "Now that I have your _attention_, let's look at what we have to understand and implement to achieve this feat.\n",

    "The transformer architecture comprises two building blocks:\n",
    "- An encoder that receives the input and builds features from it.\n",
    "- A decoder that uses these features (along with other inputs) to generate an output sequence (usually probabilities).\n",

    "Depending on the task, a model might have both or only one of the two.\n",

    "If you have ever used the [ðŸ¤— Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) you have very likely used some type of `Tokenizer`. Tokenizers implement the process described above - although on a much larger scale. When you use a tokenizer to process a piece of text, it breaks it down into tokens and assigns a unique numerical identifier (token ID) to each token. These token IDs are what the model uses as input during training or inference. The model's embedding layer then looks up the corresponding embeddings for these token IDs from its embedding matrix.\n",
