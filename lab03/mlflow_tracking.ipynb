    "We will be using MLflow Tracking for experiment management. The MLflow Tracking is an API and UI for logging parameters, code versions, metrics, and output files when running your machine learning code and for later visualizing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Runs**: Runs are executions of some piece of data science code (e.g. `python train.py`). Each run records metadata (metrics, parameters, start and end times) and as well as the artifacts produced by the code (e.g. model weights).\n",
    "- **Experiments**: An experiment groups together runs for a specific task.\n",

    "### Launching the MLflow tracking server\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various deployment configurations possible for MLflow. Here we'll simply run it locally, and store everything to local files, but a production setup would usually use cloud storage for artifacts and a database for metadata.\n",
