    "# Hyperparameter tuning with Ray Tune\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) is a library for experiment execution and hyperparameter tuning at any scale. It supports most machine learning frameworks, a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms, and integrates a wide range of dedicated hyperparameter optimization tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [six concepts to understand](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/key-concepts.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search Spaces: A search space defines the set of valid parameters for your hyperparameters.\n",
    "2. Trainable: In Tune, the objective you want to minimize/maximize is represented by a [Trainable](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/key-concepts.html#ray-tune-trainables). Trainables are [functions](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api/trainable.html#tune-function-api) or [classes](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/api/trainable.html#class-trainable-api) that take hyperparameters as input and return metric.\n",
    "3. Search Algorithms: Search algorithms do the heavy lifting, as they describe _how_ to tune the Trainable.\n",
    "4. Schedulers: Tune can optionally use a Scheduler to stop searches early and thus speed up the hyperparameter search process.\n",
    "5. Trials: Trials are a concrete combination of hyperparameter values.\n",
    "6. Analyses: After the search process has terminated, Tune will present you with a `ResultGrid`, which allows you to access various metrics such as the best available trial or the hyperparameter configuration for said trial.\n",
